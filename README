In order for lessmed to work properly you have to set up the keyword "MED" in FrontlineSMS and and an external command that interacts with lessmed.pl.

Execution Type: Command Line Execution
Command: /path/to/perl.exe /path/to/lessmed.pl ${message_content} [e.g., "../Perl/bin/perl.exe" "../JAppLabs/lessmed/lessmed.pl" ${message_content}]
Response Type: Plain Text
Message: {command_response}
Send an Auto Reply: checked

See lessmed-flsms_external_command.pdf for a screenshot.

One other thing: you have to have Perl installed ;)
